This app helps users track their daily weight, set a personal goal, and receive a notification when the goal is reached. It was designed for users who want a simple, focused tool without the extra features of full fitness apps.

To support user needs, I included a login screen, a dashboard to display weight entries, input fields for adding new weights, a goal-setting feature, and SMS notifications when a goal is reached. The UI was designed with clarity and ease of use in mind, following Android's Material Design standards.

I built the app by breaking it into small partsâ€”starting with the database, then login logic, and finally weight tracking and notifications. I tested everything using the Android Emulator to check functionality and permission handling.

One challenge was getting SMS permissions and logic to work smoothly, especially when permission was denied. I solved it by carefully checking states and fallback behavior. The database and RecyclerView integration was a highlight where I demonstrated solid understanding of local data storage and UI binding.
